//! External MCP (Model Context Protocol) server registry + JSON-RPC client.
//!
//! Two pieces live here:
//!
//! 1. [`tools`] — placeholder for the built-in tool registry (`shell`,
//!    `fs`, ...) we'll wire in alongside the agent loop in phase 2.
//! 2. [`client`] — minimal HTTP/SSE JSON-RPC client used to enumerate
//!    tools on user-configured external MCP servers and to call them
//!    from the Tools page. We deliberately keep this thin so it can be
//!    plugged into the chat runner later as just another tool surface.
//!
//! External server *configuration* is stored in `Settings.mcp_servers` so
//! it round-trips through the same settings file as everything else; only
//! the runtime client / cached schema lives in this module.
